# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis
This project demonstrates how to use Python to develop a Twitter sentiment analysis model. Sentiment analysis on Twitter is used to determine how people feel about certain subjects. We will be analysing public opinion of Pfizer vaccines as part of this project.    To build this machine learning model, we'll use the data that's accessible on Kaggle. To determine the various sentiments expressed in the tweets, machine learning will be used to analyze the tweets that have been gathered from Twitter. This investigation has found three distinct sentiments: neutral, negative, and positive sentiments. Additionally, we will experiment with various classifiers to determine which one provides the best model accuracy.
